# **Unit 5b: Strings and Lists**

---

## **Introduction**

In Python, **strings** and **lists** are two important data types that allow you to work with sequences of data. Strings let you work with text, while lists allow you to store and manipulate collections of data, such as numbers or other objects. In this unit, we will explore how to use and manipulate strings and lists in Python, as well as perform operations on them to solve a variety of tasks.

## **5b.1 Strings**

A **string** in Python is a sequence of characters enclosed in either single quotes (`' '`) or double quotes (`" "`). Strings are used to represent text in a program.

### **Initializing Strings**
You can initialize a string by assigning a sequence of characters to a variable.

**Example**:
```python
name = "Alice"
greeting = 'Hello, World!'
```

### **Accessing Strings**
You can access individual characters of a string using **indexing**. In Python, indexing starts from 0.

**Example**:
```python
name = "Alice"
print(name[0])  # Outputs: A
print(name[1])  # Outputs: l
```

### **String Operations**
Python provides several operations you can perform on strings:

1. **Concatenation**: Combine two or more strings using the `+` operator.

    **Example**:  
    ```python  
    first_name = "Alice"  
    last_name = "Smith"  
    full_name = first_name + " " + last_name  # Outputs: Alice Smith  
    ```  

2. **Repetition**: Repeat a string multiple times using the `*` operator.

    **Example**:  
    ```python  
    word = "Hi! "  
    print(word * 3)  # Outputs: Hi! Hi! Hi!  
    ```  

3. **Slicing**: Extract a substring using a range of indices.

    **Example**:  
    ```python  
    name = "Alice"  
    print(name[0:3])  # Outputs: Ali  
    ```  

4. **Length**: Find the number of characters in a string using the `len()` function.

    **Example**:  
    ```python  
    message = "Hello"  
    print(len(message))  # Outputs: 5  
    ```  

5. **Case Conversion**: Convert a string to uppercase or lowercase.

    **Example**:  
    ```python  
    text = "Hello"  
    print(text.upper())  # Outputs: HELLO  
    print(text.lower())  # Outputs: hello  
    ```  

6. **String Methods**: Strings come with a variety of useful methods, such as `strip()` to remove whitespace, `replace()` to replace characters, and `find()` to search for a substring.

    **Example**:  
    ```python  
    text = " Hello "  
    print(text.strip())  # Outputs: "Hello" (removes leading and trailing spaces)  
    ```

## **5b.2 Lists**

A **list** in Python is an ordered collection of items that can hold elements of different data types, such as numbers, strings, or even other lists. Lists are mutable, meaning you can change their content after they are created.

### **Initializing Lists**
You can create a list by placing items inside square brackets `[]`, separated by commas.

**Example**:
```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

### **Accessing Lists**
You can access elements of a list using indexing, just like strings. List indexing also starts at 0.

**Example**:
```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
print(fruits[0])  # Outputs: apple
```

### **List Operations**
There are several operations you can perform on lists:

1. **Creating Lists**: You can create an empty list and add elements to it later.

    **Example**:  
    ```python  
    my_list = []  
    my_list.append(1)  
    my_list.append(2)  
    print(my_list)  # Outputs: [1, 2]  
    ```  

2. **Initializing Lists with Data**: You can create a list and initialize it with data directly.

    **Example**:  
    ```python  
    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]  
    ```  

3. **Traversing Lists**: You can loop through a list using a `for` loop to access each element.

    **Example**:  
    ```python  
    for fruit in fruits:  
      print(fruit)  
    ```  

4. **Manipulating Lists**:
    - **Appending**: Add an element to the end of the list using `append()`.  

      **Example**:  
      ```python  
      fruits.append("orange")  
      print(fruits)  # Outputs: ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry', 'orange']  
      ```  

    - **Inserting**: Add an element at a specific index using `insert()`.  

      **Example**:  
      ```python  
      fruits.insert(1, "blueberry")  
      print(fruits)  # Outputs: ['apple', 'blueberry', 'banana', 'cherry']  
      ```  

    - **Removing**: Remove an element from the list using `remove()` or `pop()`.  

      **Example**:  
      ```python  
      fruits.remove("banana")  
      print(fruits)  # Outputs: ['apple', 'cherry']  
      ```  

    - **Sorting**: Sort the elements in the list using `sort()`.  

      **Example**:  
      ```python  
      numbers = [4, 2, 3, 1]  
      numbers.sort()  
      print(numbers)  # Outputs: [1, 2, 3, 4]  
      ```  

5. **Length of List**: Use `len()` to get the number of items in the list.

    **Example**:  
    ```python  
    print(len(fruits))  # Outputs: 3  
    ```

## **Important Terminology**

- **String**: A sequence of characters enclosed in quotes.
- **Initialization**: Assigning a value to a variable or data structure (e.g., creating a string or list).
- **Access**: Retrieving elements of a string or list using indexing.
- **String Operations**: Actions that can be performed on strings, such as concatenation, slicing, or case conversion.
- **List**: An ordered collection of items that can store different data types.
- **Traversing**: Looping through each item in a list to access or process it.
- **Manipulation**: Modifying a list by adding, removing, or changing elements.
