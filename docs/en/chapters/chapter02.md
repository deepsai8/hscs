# **Unit 2: Encoding Schemes and Number Systems**

---

## **Introduction:**

In this unit, weâ€™ll explore how computers represent data using encoding schemes and different number systems. While humans typically think in terms of decimal numbers (0-9), computers communicate and store information using other systems, like binary (0 and 1). Youâ€™ll also learn how to convert between different number systems, which is a fundamental skill in computer science. Letâ€™s break down these concepts and make them fun and easy to understand!

---

## **2.1 Encoding Schemes:**

Computers work with numbers, not letters or symbols. To help computers understand our alphabets, numbers, and even emojis, encoding schemes are used. An **encoding scheme** converts characters (like letters and punctuation) into numeric codes so that computers can store and process them.

### **ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange):**

ASCII was developed as one of the earliest encoding schemes to standardize how computers represent text and symbols. It uses **7 bits** to encode 128 different characters, including:
- **Uppercase and lowercase letters** (A-Z, a-z)
- **Numbers** (0-9)
- **Special symbols** (such as @, &, #, and punctuation marks)
- **Control characters** (like Enter, Tab, and Backspace)

**Example:**
- The ASCII code for the letter **A** is **65**.
- The ASCII code for the symbol **@** is **64**.

However, ASCII is limited. Since it uses only 7 bits, it can only represent **128 characters**, which is not enough for languages other than English or for newer symbols like emojis.

---

### **UNICODE:**

To address the limitations of ASCII, **UNICODE** was developed. It can represent over **143,000 characters** from a variety of languages and symbol sets, making it a universal encoding scheme. UNICODE uses **16 bits** or more to represent characters, allowing it to handle different writing systems such as:
- **Latin** (for English and other languages)
- **Cyrillic** (for Russian and related languages)
- **Chinese characters**
- **Emojis** (Yes, even your favorite emojis like ðŸ˜ƒ have unique UNICODE numbers!)

UNICODE has become the global standard for encoding characters in digital text, ensuring that all languages and symbols can be represented consistently across different platforms.

**Example:**
The smiley emoji **ðŸ˜ƒ** has a UNICODE value of **U+1F603**.

**Why is UNICODE important?**
With the world connected through the internet, we need a system that represents characters from every language. Whether you're writing in English, Russian, or Japanese, or sending an emoji, UNICODE makes sure the computer understands what youâ€™re saying.

## **2.2 Number Systems:**

In computing, different **number systems** are used to represent and process data. While we humans typically use the **decimal system** (Base 10), computers use the **binary system** (Base 2) because they can only process two states: **on (1)** and **off (0)**.

---

### **Decimal Number System (Base 10):**

The decimal system is the one we use every day. Itâ€™s called **Base 10** because it uses ten digits: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. We can represent any number using these digits by placing them in positions that are powers of 10.

**Example:**
- The number **125** in decimal is represented as:
  \[
  1 \times 10^2 + 2 \times 10^1 + 5 \times 10^0 = 100 + 20 + 5 = 125
  \]

This is how we naturally count, but itâ€™s not suitable for computers.

---

### **Binary Number System (Base 2):**

Computers use the **binary system**, which is based on **two digits**: 0 and 1. This system is called **Base 2** because it only has two possible values. Every binary digit (bit) represents a power of 2, just as every decimal digit represents a power of 10.

**Example:**
- The binary number **101** means:
  \[
  1 \times 2^2 + 0 \times 2^1 + 1 \times 2^0 = 4 + 0 + 1 = 5
  \]

While binary numbers may seem long, they are crucial for computers because they map directly to the on/off states of electronic circuits.

**Fun Fact:**
Think of binary like a light switch: **1** means "on" and **0** means "off." Your computer is flipping millions of these "switches" every second to perform tasks!

---

### **Octal Number System (Base 8):**

The **octal system** uses eight digits: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7, and is based on **Base 8**. It was commonly used in early computers because itâ€™s easier to convert between binary and octal than between binary and decimal.

**Example:**
- The octal number **17** means:
  \[
  1 \times 8^1 + 7 \times 8^0 = 8 + 7 = 15 \text{ in decimal}
  \]

---

### **Hexadecimal Number System (Base 16):**

The **hexadecimal system** uses **16 symbols**: the digits 0-9 and the letters A-F, where:
- **A = 10**
- **B = 11**
- **C = 12**
- **D = 13**
- **E = 14**
- **F = 15**

This system is very useful in computing because it allows large binary numbers to be represented more compactly.

**Example:**
- The hexadecimal number **1A** means:
  \[
  1 \times 16^1 + A \times 16^0 = 16 + 10 = 26 \text{ in decimal}
  \]

**Why Hexadecimal?**
Hexadecimal is often used in programming and computing because itâ€™s easier to work with than long strings of binary numbers. For example, the binary number **11111111** can be written more compactly as **FF** in hexadecimal.

## **2.3 Converting Between Number Systems:**

Understanding how to convert between different number systems is a core skill in computer science. Letâ€™s look at some conversion techniques:

---

### **Decimal to Binary:**

To convert a decimal number to binary:
1. **Divide** the decimal number by 2.
2. **Write down the remainder** (0 or 1).
3. **Continue dividing** the result by 2, writing down the remainders, until the quotient is 0.
4. **The binary number** is the sequence of remainders read in reverse order.

**Example:**
Convert **13** to binary.
13 Ã· 2 = 6 remainder **1**
6 Ã· 2 = 3 remainder **0**
3 Ã· 2 = 1 remainder **1**
1 Ã· 2 = 0 remainder **1**
So, **13** in decimal is **1101** in binary.

---

### **Binary to Decimal:**

To convert a binary number to decimal:
1. **Multiply each bit** by \(2^n\), where **n** is the position of the bit, starting from 0 on the right.
2. **Add the results**.

**Example:**
Convert **1101** to decimal.
\(1 \times 2^3 + 1 \times 2^2 + 0 \times 2^1 + 1 \times 2^0 = 8 + 4 + 0 + 1 = 13\).

---

### **Decimal to Hexadecimal:**

To convert a decimal number to hexadecimal:
1. **Divide the decimal number** by 16.
2. **Write down the remainder** (0-9, A-F).
3. **Continue dividing** the result by 16 until the quotient is 0.
4. **The hexadecimal number** is the sequence of remainders read in reverse order.

**Example:**
Convert **255** to hexadecimal.
255 Ã· 16 = 15 remainder **15 (F)**
15 Ã· 16 = 0 remainder **15 (F)**
So, **255** in decimal is **FF** in hexadecimal.

---

### **Hexadecimal to Decimal:**

To convert a hexadecimal number into decimal:
1. **Multiply each digit** by \(16^n\), where **n** is the position of the digit, starting from 0 on the right.
2. **Add the results**.

**Example:**
Convert **1A** to decimal.
\(1 \times 16^1 + A \times 16^0 = 16 + 10 = 26\).
